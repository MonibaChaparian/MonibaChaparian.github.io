Achieving an impressive accuracy of 95.39%, the project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in real-world applications.\n Key Highlights: \n Applied standardization and PCA for sensor data preprocessing. Developed a neural network with dropout and L1 regularization to reduce overfitting. Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports, complemented by visualization of loss, accuracy trends, and heatmaps. Demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks in activity recognition, highlighting the significance of data preprocessing and thorough evaluation.","link":"https://github.com/MonibaChaparian/Human_activities_recognition"},{"name":"Trie Tree Implementation","description":"This project implements a Trie data structure for efficient string storage and retrieval. Users can insert, search, delete, and display words through a simple menu interface. The Trie is useful for applications like auto-complete and spell checking, offering fast prefix-based searching.","link":"https://github.com/MonibaChaparian/Trie_Tree"},{"name":"GoldMine","description":"This project implements an algorithm that calculates the maximum gold collectible in a grid-based gold mine. The miner can move right, right-up, or right-down, and the algorithm finds the most profitable path. It identifies the cell with the highest gold value and traces the optimal route to collect it. This solution efficiently handles grid-based pathfinding, making it ideal for resource optimization problems.","link":"https://github.com/MonibaChaparian/Gold_Mine"},{"name":"Maze","description":"This project is a visual Maze Generator and Solver built in Java. It generates random mazes using recursive algorithms and solves them with Breadth-First Search (BFS).
